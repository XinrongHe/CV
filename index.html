          <h3>Design & Development</h3>
          <p>I started to gain interest in coding when I was in third-year high school. Back then I took a planning course, and I got to play with an APP on APPLE to learn to code with Swift. I totally fell in love with Computer Science by solving the challenge on the APP, so I decided to combine Computer Science with my BCOM major when I received an offer from UBC Sauder School of Business. As I already studied in UBC for two years now, I learned a lot of technique skills such as Java, C, C++, and data structures. Besides school, I also am taking a Full Stack course on udemy to broaden my horizon.</p>

          <h3>Swimming</h3>
          <p>I was previously studied in a professional sport school in Guangzhou China, being a competitive swimmer for approximately seven years of my life. During this time, I have participated in most of the city level's competitions in Guangzhou and some of the provincial level's competitions, and I was certified as first, second, and third place in most of these competitions. It was a valuable experience in learning how to work with teams and maintain good relationships with teammates. Since I have to constantly push myself beyond limits to achieve goals, I have grown a lot and became persistent through this experience.</p>
